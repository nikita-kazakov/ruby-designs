By Arthur O'Shaughnessy


I'm editing in the branchpoem.
I'd like to add some robert frost in here and make this entire poem shorter.  Cut some stuff.

We are the music makers,
    And we are the dreamers of dreams,
Wandering by lone sea-breakers,
    And sitting by desolate streams; â€”
World-losers and world-forsakers,
    On whom the pale moon gleams:
Yet we are the movers and shakers
    Of the world for ever, it seems.
    But here is the difference #1.  Why?
