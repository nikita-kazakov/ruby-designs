# It would be easy to introduce a defect to code like this.

#Lesson learned: The second way of doing it didn't modify the greeting message.
# We only modified WHERE the values came from. Greeting itself shouldn't care where the values
# come from. It just needs the values. Greeting should only be concerned with how it TIES those
# values together into a human readable string.

#A Bareword is a PERL word. Our barewords were {title}, {progname}, {version}. Notice how flexible these were.
#If we had used an instance variable @title, @progname, we'd have to change a LOT. Using barewords, we can
#Flexibly change the source of the data for the bareword by keeping it as a variable, instance variable, method, module, etc...
#User barewords where possible before moving into using instance variables, class variables or constants.
